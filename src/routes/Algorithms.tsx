    <p>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task. It is a precise and unambiguous sequence of operations that takes some input and produces an output.</p>
    <p>Algorithms can be found in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and everyday life. In computer science, algorithms are particularly important and are used extensively in programming and software development.</p>
    <p>Here are some key characteristics of algorithms:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Well-defined inputs and outputs: An algorithm has clear and well-defined inputs, which are the data or information it operates on, and outputs, which are the desired results or outcomes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finite steps: Algorithms are composed of a finite number of well-defined steps or operations. Each step must be clear, unambiguous, and executable</p></li>
        <li><p>Deterministic or probabilistic: Algorithms can be deterministic, meaning that they produce the same output for a given input every time they are executed, or probabilistic, meaning that they introduce an element of randomness or probability.</p></li>
        <li><p>Termination: An algorithm must eventually terminate after a finite number of steps, providing the desired output or indicating that no solution is possible.</p></li>
        <li><p>Efficiency: Algorithms are often evaluated based on their efficiency, which refers to how quickly they can solve a problem and how effectively they utilize computational resources such as time and memory.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples of algorithms include sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), and encryption algorithms (e.g., RSA).</p>
    <p>In summary, algorithms are systematic procedures that allow us to solve problems or perform tasks in a logical and efficient manner, providing a set of instructions that guide the solution process.</p>
